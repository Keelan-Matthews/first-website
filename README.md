# Demon Slayer Review Website

https://demon-slayer-review.netlify.app/

This was the first full-fledged website I coded. It was for a University project and we were given 4 weeks to complete it. The requirement was that it had to be a website about a movie.

## Task
Develop a simple website that showcases a movie of your choice. It needs a home page, merchandise page, news page, plot page, cast page, gallery page, reviews page and miscellaneous pages. It cannot exceed 8 pages.
