                        Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu, and Inosuke board a train [N 1] to assist the Flame Hashira Kyōjurō
                        Rengoku in his mission to hunt for a demon that has killed many demon slayers. Soon after boarding,
                        all of them are enchanted and fall into a deep sleep. Enmu, Lower Rank One of the Twelve Kizuki,
                        instructs four passengers, all suffering from severe insomnia, to enter the demon slayers' dreams
                        and destroy their spiritual cores so that they can't wake up again. In exchange, Enmu will allow
                        them a peaceful sleep.

                        During their sleep, Tanjiro and his companions have happy dreams. Tanjiro realizes that he is
                        dreaming and tries to wake up, succeeding after a vision of his father instructs him to kill himself
                        in the dream. At the same time, Nezuko uses her power to sever the intruders' connection, and awaken
                        the passengers. In fear of Enmu, they attack Tanjiro, who knocks them out.

                        While Nezuko awakens the others, Tanjiro confronts Enmu, and in the ensuing battle, beheads him.
                        However, Enmu does not die, and reveals that he fused his head with the train. Kyōjurō instructs
                        Inosuke and Tanjiro to look for Enmu's neck while he, Nezuko, and Zenitsu stay behind to protect the
                        other passengers. Tanjiro and Inosuke find Enmu's neckbone in the engine room and Tanjiro severs it,
                        killing Enmu and stopping the train.

                        However, Akaza, the Upper Moon Three, appears soon after and attacks the demon slayers. Kyōjurō
                        fights him alone, and is fatally wounded, although Akaza is forced to flee when the sun begins
                        rising. Tanjiro angrily calls him a coward for running away and declares Kyōjurō the winner of the
                        fight. Kyōjurō encourages Tanjiro and his friends, and dies. The Hashira and Demon Slayer Corps are
                        informed of his death, while Tanjiro and the others mourn him.
