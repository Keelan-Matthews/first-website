                        but also has a lot of heart, as a lot of people will see in this movie, which introduces one of
                        the other Hashiras of the Demon Slayer Corps.

                    <h2>The action, the feeling, it's PERFECT</h2>
                    <p class="content">
                        I was worried because the movie is in the train, and I was afraid it will become boring. After I
                        finished the movie, i realize that I shouldn't worried about this thing from the start. Every
                        scene in this movie is really well planed, if the action scene start getting too long they will
                        change it into another scene so we will not get bored with the action (I mean the composition of
                        action and te conversation is balance.)
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">
                        And then the effects, both 3D and 2D. It's P E R F E C T. Even though we only have 2 hours to
                        know Rengoku character, but the feeling, the emotion still really hit me. Like I cry a river in
                        the cinemaðŸ˜¬
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">
                        It's really recommended! But please remind this in your mind that you need to watch the season 1
                        before you watch this movie.

                    <h2>I'm speechless...</h2>
                    <p class="content">
                        There isn't enough ink or paper in the world to write down everything i loved about this visual
                        spectacle, not that my words could even scratch the surface of fully captivating this level of
                        quality. So I'll just say the things that stopped this masterful work from being a 10/10. There
                        is an large amount of blatant exposition is this film, there are times when it makes sense for a
                        character to be revealing such information but Enmu just stood on top of the train telling his
                        entire plan and more for over 10 minutes for no reason. The music is still top notch but I don't
                        think it was nearly as powerful as the score in the 1st season which stuck to more traditional
                        Japanese instruments. Stop reading this already and go watch it!!!
